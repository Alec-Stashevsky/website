I am a data scientist and researcher with experience consulting in the finance and energy spaces. I am passionate about interdisciplinary research that engages multiple paradigms. I care about econometrics, anthropology, statistics, and research that uses data holistically to push back against siloed analytics.

Currently, I am solving problems at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.
