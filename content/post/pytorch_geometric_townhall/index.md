Last week I got the opportunity to share how we are using [PyTorch Geometric](https://www.pyg.org/) at [Fetch](https://fetch.com/) as their very first industrial use-case presentation! PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is an open source deep learning library for graphs and other geometries. Check out the talk below.
