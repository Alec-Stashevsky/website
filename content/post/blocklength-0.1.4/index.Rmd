I'm excited to announce that `blocklength` 0.1.4 is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=blocklength)! `blocklength` is designed to be used with block-bootstrap procedures and makes it quick and easy to select a block-length quantitatively. 

Install it with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blocklength")
```

The most important changes are highlighted below and you can see a full list of changes in the [changelog](https://alecstashevsky.com/r/blocklength/news).


## Changes

`blocklength` has received a fancy hex sticker! Thanks to Malina Cheeneebash

A new [vignette](https://alecstashevsky.com/r/blocklength/articles/tuning-parameters) has been included on tuning and diagnosing problematic output from the block-length selection functions!

Some [bug fixes](https://alecstashevsky.com/r/blocklength/news/index.html#bug-fixes).


## Acknowledgements 

A big thanks goes out to Malina Cheeneebash for designing the blocklength hex sticker! Also to [Simon P. Couch](https://www.simonpcouch.com) and Sergio Armella for their contributions!
