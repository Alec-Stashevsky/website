<p>In this post, I reexamine the ways we navigate to large conferences from around the world and how the carbon emissions of such conferences can be mitigated while still preserving the important community-building that thrives at such events. I consider the carbon footprint of holding a large conference through multiple, smaller meetings compared to holding one large centrally-located meeting. I call this framework a <em>regional format</em> for conferences throughout this post.</p>
<p>This post is a case study expanding upon the solutions offered by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">Wortzel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, a paper recently published by myself and a team of Psychiatrists at the <a href="https://ourgap.org">Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP).</a> We estimated the carbon footprint associated with the 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings of the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/about-apa">American Psychiatric Association (APA)</a> then measured how this carbon footprint changes if meetings are held in different locations.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
The APA is the largest psychiatric association in the world with almost 40 thousand members worldwide.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>We find that the location of the meeting can have a significant impact on the carbon footprint. For example, holding the Annual Meeting in Hawaii would produce more emissions than holding over 2.5 Annual Meetings in New York City if the same people attended.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
We argue that large conferences like the APA Annual Meeting should incorporate the added environmental cost of remote conference destinations. By taking into account the geographic dispersion of their attendance base and choosing a location accordingly large conferences can drastically reduce their environmental impact while changing little else. This post expands upon <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">Wortzel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> by examining the potential of a <em>regional conference format</em> to mitigate carbon emissions in addition to optimizing conference location.</p>
<div id="the-story" class="section level2">
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Recently, I got the opportunity to support some great research with a team of Psychiatrists on the <a href="https://ourgap.org/page-18095">GAP Climate Committee.</a> In the midst of the pandemic lock-downs we sought a silver lining and exploited the global transformation of the day-to-day movement of humans.</p>
<p>The unique situation of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to use this research as a gauge for how much carbon emissions <em>were saved  </em> by holding the 2020 APA conference virtually.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
In fact, that decision prompted the idea for this research. If you are interested in the original analysis, you may read the paper at <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641">JAMA Network Open (no paywall).</a></p>
<p>The bottom line is that COVID-19 has radically changed the way <em>humans</em> move through space and this change foreshadows the dramatic behavioral and structural shifts climate change demands from humankind.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with work commutes and industry/professional travel have substantially decreased, leading to distinct improvements in air and water quality (<em>see</em> <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-YUNUS2020139012" role="doc-biblioref">Yunus, Masago, and Hijioka</a> (<a href="#ref-YUNUS2020139012" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Venter18984" role="doc-biblioref">Venter et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Venter18984" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>). The International Energy Agency expects global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to drop 8% compared to 2019, the largest reduction ever (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-IEA-Global-energy" role="doc-biblioref">Reuscher, Baguley, and Montagna</a> (<a href="#ref-IEA-Global-energy" role="doc-biblioref">2020a</a>)</span>).</p>
<!--Tourism, responsible for 8% of global GHG emissions, has all but stopped (@Lenzen2018). --->
<p>This unprecedented reduction in activity has certainly come with many costs, but it is at this crux that such a reassessment can be most enlightening and effective. As we long to return to <em>normal</em>, it is my intent that this research provokes a more thoughtful return. COVID-19 has presented us with an opportunity to rethink the ways we navigate and embody shared spaces, especially when these spaces function as epicenters to build specialized communities whose members are otherwise scattered throughout the world—whether that be communities centered upon <a href="https://comic-con.org/wca/2021/athome">comic books</a>, <a href="https://www.itic.co/">insurance</a>, <a href="https://scubashow.com/">SCUBA-diving</a>, <a href="https://seattlervshow.com/">recreational vehicles</a>, or <a href="https://waset.org/mycology-conferences">mushrooms</a> (a personal favorite).</p>
<p>The carbon footprint of such conferences has been shown to be substantial. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">Wortzel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> estimate the 2018 and 2019 APA Annual Meetings produced about 20 thousand metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions each—an amount equal to burning 22 million pounds of coal. This carbon footprint is highly dependent on the meeting location which can more than double (or half) the footprint.</p>
<p>The case study in this post is built upon the research of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">Wortzel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, but is by no means limited by context of the APA Annual Meetings. There are hundreds of medical and medical professional associations across the US<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and thousands more industry, professional, hobby, and entertainment based conventions held yearly. As of 2017, almost 35 million square meters of indoor space was dedicated to some form of exhibition.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The APA Annual Meeting is by no means a large conference even in the context of medical associations, let alone framed within the global exhibition industry. When we consider the impact of such <em>carbon-conscious</em> planning on an industry-level, the potential reduction in emissions could be considerable.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-language-of-emisisons" class="section level2">
<h2>A Language of Emisisons</h2>
<p>Before we dig into the details of this case study, I want to discuss some common terminology that is often mischaracterized. I am intentionally guilty of some of this mischaracterization so far in this post. I have chosen to conflate terms like <em>emissions, carbon emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, carbon footprint, environmental impact,</em> and <em>environmental harm</em>, in order to tease out some important distinctions.</p>
<p>Often times, these phrases are used a synonyms, but this is not the case. Most people understand that a carbon footprint is some measure of environmental impact and that a high carbon footprint = bad and a low carbon footprint = less bad. This is somewhat true, but there are many aspects of <em>environmental harm</em> that the <em>carbon footprint</em> does not measure.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article240263391.html">Deepwater Horizon</a>, the largest oil spill in history<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, caused unimaginable damage to natural ecosystems yet very little of this impact can be captured through the lens of the carbon footprint. Studies on the <em>environmental impacts</em> of Deepwater Horizon range from the severe harm of surface oil on marine mammals to the habitat destruction of deep-water coral and microfauna.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Minor aspects of the spill have been studied through the lens of carbon footprint. For example, during the spill large amounts of oil leaked towards the ocean surface where one of the main remediation strategies was “controlled surface burning.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-FISG-deepwater" role="doc-biblioref">Lehr, Bristol, and Possolo</a> (<a href="#ref-FISG-deepwater" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> estimate approximately 5% of the <strong>total leaked oil</strong> was burned on the surface, releasing over one million pounds (450 metric tons) of black carbon soot into the atmosphere.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> This amount pales in comparison to the true damage from the oil spill.</p>
<p>My point here is that the <em>carbon footprint</em> (which we have yet to define) is not a holistic measure of environmental friendliness/harm and it is misleading and potentially damaging to use the carbon footprint as a gauge for how harmful something is. The most damaging human-induced events like oil spills or nuclear meltdowns have carbon footprints far outmeasured by the loss of wildlife and habitat.</p>
<div id="history-of-the-carbon-footprint" class="section level3">
<h3>History of the Carbon Footprint</h3>
<p>Though I use the term <em>carbon footprint</em> throughout this post, I want to acknowledge the (not so pretty) history behind the term. <em>Carbon footprint</em> grew out of a related concept—the <em>ecological footprint</em>—invented in the 1990s by an ecologist William Rees and a regional planner Mathis Wackernagel.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>However it was not until the early 2000s that the term was popularized by oil giant BP. In 2004, BP unveiled the first “carbon footprint calculator” which provided individuals with a way to quantify how much heat-trapping carbon pollution they were releasing into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, it provided users with no way of measuring the carbon footprint of drilling deep into the Earth to extract fossil fuels and occasionally dumping thousands of gallons of toxic fuel into the ocean.</p>
<p>Shifting the discourse of pollution onto the individual has long been a tactic of the largest corporate polluters. Even before we thought to worry about carbon pollution, we had marketing campaigns touting the righteousness of voluntary action. Recycling, bottle bills, and littering. In what appears to be the longest ad any millennial has ever seen, the famous “Crying Indian” first aired in 1971 on Earth day with the line: “People start pollution. People can stop it.” Little did they know corporations would become people anyways.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>{{% youtube "Xm66Ww6qTpA" %}}</p>
<p>The ad is sponsored by Keep America Beautiful, a non-profit founded by Phillip Morris and whose major sponsors include PepsiCo, Waste Management, Anheuser-Busch, Georgia-Pacific, Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and McDonald’s.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>
I will refrain from saying much else on this matter, but if you’re curious I would dig into the <a href="https://in.mashable.com/science/15520/the-carbon-footprint-sham">history of pollution marketing</a> or <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/">why you can’t save the planet by going vegan.</a></p>
<p>Oh yeah, in case you were getting tired of punching in your electricity bill into BP’s carbon footprint calculator to help you sleep at night, don’t worry. BP has gone through the trouble of <a href="https://grist.org/energy/footprint-fantasy">developing an app that does it for you</a>, backed by their quasi venture capital subsidiary, Launchpad.</p>

<div id="back-to-business" class="section level3">
<h3>Back to Business</h3>
<p>To understand what the <em>carbon footprint</em> attempts to measure, we first need to understand how gaseous emissions capture heat.</p>
<p>Certain gases like carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) have molecular structures that absorb heat. These gases are transparent to the human eye (visible light), but <em>opaque</em> to longer wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum like infrared radiation. When energy from the sun enters Earth’s atmosphere some of the heat is absorbed by these gas molecules causing them to vibrate more. Gas molecules which absorb heat in this manner are referred to as <em>Greenhouse Gases</em> (GHGs) because they cause the Earth’s atmosphere to capture and reemit heat much like the windows in a greenhouse. This process is pictured below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/regional-conferences/GHG-diagram.jpg" /></p>
<p>As energy from the sun enters the Earth’s atmosphere and is reflected by the Earth’s surface, some of it becomes trapped by GHGs. GHGs naturally occur in Earth’s atmosphere but the burning of fossil fuels and other chemicals have and continue to rapidly increase the level of GHGs thus trapping more and more heat and contributing to global warming and climate change. This is essentially thickening the windows and increasing the insulation of the greenhouse.</p>
<p>However, GHGs are not all the same. Some are better at absorbing heat than others, and some last longer in the atmosphere before breaking down.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
We can gauge the warming abilities of different GHGs by measuring how much additional warming they cause compared to carbon dioxide over a given time period, generally 100 years. This measurement is referred to as the <em>global warming potential</em> (GWP) of a GHG. The table below illustrates common GHGs and their corresponding GWP. Data are from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">2014 Fifth Assessment Report</a>.</p>

<p>Here we can see that releasing one kilogram of methane gas into the atmosphere is 25 times better at trapping heat than releasing the same amount of carbon dioxide. Sulfur hexafluoride, a gas used mainly by the energy industry as an insulator and spark-suppressant in power transmission and distribution systems all over the world, is 23,500 times better at trapping heat than an equivalent mass of carbon dioxide.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<div id="measuring-the-carbon-footprint" class="section level3">
<h3>Measuring the Carbon Footprint</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most common GHG emitted by human activities, both in terms of the quantity released and the total impact on global warming. Due to this “CO<sub>2</sub>” is sometimes used as a shorthand expression for all greenhouse gases, but this is misleading. Greenhouse gas inventories are more complete if they include all GHGs and not just CO<sub>2</sub>, yet many GHG assessments or reports only include CO<sub>2</sub>, disregarding other greenhouse gases and leading to an understatement of total global warming impact <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-brander2012greenhouse" role="doc-biblioref">Brander and Davis</a> (<a href="#ref-brander2012greenhouse" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. Sometimes this measure of only CO<sub>2</sub> is referred to as the <em>carbon footprint</em> of a process, but usually other GHGs are involved in which case it is better to refer to such a measure as the total <em>carbon dioxide emissions,</em> rather than the <em>carbon footprint</em>.</p>
<p>However, to produce a better measure we can instead describe all GHGs under a common unit called <em>carbon dioxide equivalents</em> (CO<sub>2</sub><em>e</em>) which capture the total impact to global warming from all different GHGs in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide it would take to have an equivalent impact on global warming from all GHGs. This is a more accurate way of measuring the <em>carbon footprint</em> of a process because it is more comprehensive.</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub><em>e</em> is a very useful measure because it allows us to bundle different GHGs and compare them across contexts. For example, we can capture the total impact to global warming from the emission of 1 kilogram of methane and 1 kilogram of sulfur hexafluoride by multiplying the amount of each GHG by its corresponding GWP in the above table. The emission of these gasses would then be equivalent to
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align} 1\ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{methane} \ \times 25 &amp;= 25 \ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{CO}_2e, \\ 
1\ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{sulfur hexafluoride} \ \times 23,500 &amp;= 23,500 \ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{CO}_2e.
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we would say this process has a total carbon footprint of 23,525 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Terms like <em>carbon</em> and <em>carbon emissions</em> are often used to refer to a variety of measurements in the context of global warming. Sometimes they are used to refer to just CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and sometimes they are used to refer to GHGs in general. Moreover, converting CO<sub>2</sub> or other GHGs to their elemental carbon counterparts does little to aid in comparison across GHGs. Rather it is generally used as a shorthand in terms like “carbon accounting” or “low carbon future” as proxies for the more accurate “GHG accounting” or “low GHG future.”</p>
<p>It is important to be careful with the ways we characterize our understanding of processes which contribute to global warming so that we authentically and holistically capture what we can measure and acknowledge what we cannot. Its best to be explicit and avoid terms like carbon emissions and to clearly define what is being measured and included in <em>carbon footprint</em> if that term is used. In what follows, I return to the analysis of regional conferences and will do my best to avoid further conflating terminology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a-regional-conference-format" class="section level2">
<h2>A Regional Conference Format</h2>
<p>Though regional conferences do not bring <em>whole</em> communities together in one space, there are many aspects that make regional conferences an attractive format, especially if they are held as supplements to large centrally-located conferences.</p>
<p>For one, regional conferences are much smaller and usually break up a community into geographically-connected regions. This smaller format may be easier to administer, less costly, and provide attendees with more intimate opportunities to network with local colleagues. This smaller format may increase engagement in working groups or activities limited by size or participation.</p>
<p>Regional meetings allow for discourse built-up from a more concentrated membership. This may be particularly beneficial for associations advancing policy because such a format allows regions to develop a set of priorities most relevant to them (such as focusing on state or municipal policy) and then advance this smaller set of priorities to a larger base on a national or international scale who may in turn provide much needed support.</p>
<p>For example, US-based medical associations assess and respond to range of policies at the federal and state levels. A regional conference format may allow for discourse that takes place in these 1-5 days to focus more on particularly important state/local regulation which may not appear on the horizon for members outside of the region or district. This format encourages regional members to hone their priorities before larger meetings and present a more concise set of objectives to the entire association rather than having to weigh-in these priorities simultaneously in a larger sea of regulation where they are more likely to go unacknowledged.</p>
<p>Regional meetings may also have the potential to increase total attendance for several reasons. Some members may find it too expensive or too time consuming to travel long distances. This may alienate sections of the member base in fringe geographies and discourage others who feel not enough of their colleagues will attend.</p>
<p>On the other hand, traveling to remote conference destinations can be attractive for those who wish this time to double as a vacation; However, this may leave the conference vulnerable to drops in attendance if locations are <em>cycled</em> across different areas and some are more favorable than others. Such a framework may introduce priorities contradictory to emission reductions as meeting planners may be encouraged to hold meetings in more remote places to encourage attendance significantly increasing the emissions associated with travel.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-regional-format-for-the-apa" class="section level2">
<h2>A Regional Format for the APA</h2>
<p>Regional formats can be easy to implement in medical associations or associations involved with advancing policy because there are often existing structures in the administration allowing regions or districts to act independently to a degree. US-based medical associations, like the APA, often have some international base which may or may not be included in the regional structure.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>The APA has 7 distinct regions between the US and Canada.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Below is a map of these regions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>New England &amp; Eastern Canada</li>

<div id="simulation-framework" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulation Framework</h2>
<p>Using attendance data from the APA’s 2018 New York City and 2019 San Francisco Annual Meetings, we assign each attendee to one of seven designated regions based on their origin location and then identify likely transport modes and routes according the assumptions laid out in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">Wortzel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to simulate the way attendees would travel to the regional conferences, I had to extend some assumptions from our previous analysis. One critical assumption was how to deal with international (non-Canadian) attendees which are not assigned to any region in the APA’s existing structure, depicted in the map above.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In this respect we assume international (non-Canadian) attendees will travel to whichever meeting is closest to them. This also ensures our emissions estimation remains conservative.</p>
<p>The second extending assumption was the location of the seven regional meetings. The purpose of the analysis is to quantify the affect of holding multiple smaller regional conferences compared one large one, <em>ceteris paribus</em>. However, in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">Wortzel et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> we show that the location of the meeting can have a large impact on the carbon footprint. For this reason, in order to isolate the effect of moving to a regional format and eliminate the noise from different locations, we chose to:</p>

<li><p>Re-use locations of past APA Annual meetings whenever possible.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Conduct an additional sensitivity test on regional meeting locations allowing <em>all</em> attendees to travel to the closest regional meeting, regardless of their designation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a map of the seven regional meeting locations used in the simulation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/regional-conferences/Regional-locations.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="visualizing-regions" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualizing Regions</h2>
<p>To understand the effect of the regional categorization, it helps to compare the flight networks under the regular, single Annual Meeting framework. In the image below, we can see the flight network of the 2018 New York City APA Annual Meeting where over 16 thousand members attended. This map shows everyone who attended the 2018 meeting based on their reported residence. Each light orange point represents a unique residence and the size of and opacity of the points is proportional to the number of attendees traveling from that location. The darker-orange arcs indicate the <em>geodesic distance</em> or distance <em>as the crow flies</em> between each unique residence location and the location of the 2018 New York City meeting. This is the shortest path between two points on the globe.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="/images/regional-conferences/NYC-network.png" /></p>
<p>Here we can see all attendees converge on the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gekiRZY7aPxe7qUo9">Javits Center</a> in New York City. Now, we can apply the APA’s regional designations and assign international (non-Canadian) attendees a regional destination according to assumption <em>(i)</em> to generate a map like the one depicted below, where each color represents a distinct APA region. The width and intensity of each arc is proportional to the number of attendees originating from a given location.</p>
<p><img src="/images/regional-conferences/NYC-regional-network.png" /></p>
<p>Here we can see that under our current framework most of the European attendees are getting absorbed into Region 3—the New York City conference. Most of South and East Asia are absorbed by Region 7—the Seattle conference, and some of the Australian attendees are absorbed by Region 6—the Los Angeles conference.</p>
<p>Though it may not be clear from the maps, we want to make sure that our regional simulation is plausible such that it balances the attendance base of the APA somewhat evenly across regions.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes I import the simulation data and plot the attendance base across regions by transport mode. If you are curious, all the code for this is available at my <a href="https://github.com/Alec-Stashevsky/GAP-climate-research/blob/c3c960efd5138ef34c326f12693f223509fa3097/code/Regional%20Analysis/05%20-%20Regional%20Emissions%20Plots.Rmd">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The panel on the left shows the attendance for each regional conference using the APA’s attendance data from the 2018 New York City Annual meeting. The panel on the right uses attendance data collected from the 2019 San Francisco Annual meeting. Each bar represents an individual region and the bars are colored by the transport mode the attendees took to each region. A larger area of purple would indicate more attendees drove directly to the meeting, rather than flying (blue).</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/Regional%20Attendance%20Plots-1.svg" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the most part the total number of attendees at each regional meeting is around 1.5 to 3 thousand, with the exception of Region 2 on the left panel (2018 Data). This is a good indication that the regional designations assigned by the APA and our assumptions about international attendees break the membership base into somewhat even parts. If we consider this column plot along with the regional flight network map depicted above, we can see the New York city meeting receives the majority of international attendees whom are largely from Europe. When we use the 2019 Data the attendance is much more even.</p>
<div id="bias-in-attendance-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Bias in Attendance Data</h3>
<p>I won’t go into all the implications of why the 2018 and 2019 attendance data sets may be different, but I want to address some inherent biases in the data. Because these data were collected based on the actual attendance of the 2018 and 2019 APA Annual Meetings, we need to consider how this may affect our analysis, specifically our ability to compare between meetings or predict who will attend what meetings.</p>
<p>Generally, the farther away a conference is, the less likely one is to attend. Traveling farther away is more costly, more time consuming, and it is much easier to drive directly rather than fly if its reasonable. Together these factors influence the range of people who attend each meeting. I call this phenomenon <em>geographic bias.</em></p>
<p>Such bias is present is likely present in the APA attendance data. The 2018 New York City meeting data shows a smaller proportion of members from the West Coast even though approximately three thousand more people attended the meeting compared to the 2019 San Francisco one. Similarly, the proportion of attendees from the West Coast increased the the following year at the 2019 meeting.</p>
<p>Though the APA has almost 40 thousand members, only about 13 to 17 thousand attended each meeting. Thus, it is important to have a sense of what factors draw out certain sections of the APA membership and how that could affect our results. It is clear that the meeting’s location exerts influence over who attends the meeting through proximity based on a review of the 2018 and 2019 data; However, there is likely a nexus of other factors that we cannot observe by simply comparing the two data sets and if we were to perform a similar analysis using only one year, it is very likely that our results would be biased towards the people closest to that meeting. We might find that meetings held closer to this critical mass are optimal (in terms of emissions), but we know nothing about what that attendance <em>would</em> look like in an alternate universe where the APA Meeting was held under the beautiful Grand Tetons in, say, Jackson Hole, Wyoming instead of New York City.</p>
<p>In this sense, the analysis would surely benefit from a broader set of attendance data. Data which includes a geographically-diverse set of of conferences. This way, it would be possible to tease out the different sections of the APA’s membership that <em>would have come</em> if the meeting was closer to them.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

If one measure does not include sulfur hexafluoride, for example, in its calculation then it may not be a fair comparison to another carbon footprint which does include sulfur hexafluoride in its calculation of CO<sub>2</sub><em>e</em> emissions.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Often times, select international countries may be lumped in with domestic US regions. This is the case with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) as well as the APA, which groups Canadian regions together with US regions. Other times, international members may not be part of any region and simply attend the large annual or national meetings.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn20"><p>Specifically, we classify attendees into drivers if they are within 400 km of the regional meeting they are attending. Attendees more than 400 km away from their regional meeting will drive to their nearest commercial airport and then fly to the airport nearest the regional meeting location. The driving distance is measured as the geodesic distances between locatoins. We then apply an emissions function to the ground and air legs of each attendee’s route. These emissions functions are based on EPA guidelines and a <a href="https://api.goclimate.com/docs">flight emissions API from GoClimate.</a><a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>25-30 percent of the 2018 and 2019 APA Annual Meeting attendees are international attendees (including Canadians).<a href="#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>The one exception to this case was choosing a location for Region 7 because no meetings have historically been held this area. The choice of the Region 7 location is particularly important because Region 7 has the largest area of all the APA regions, and this greater distance members must travel will increase the sensitivity of the carbon emission estimates with respect to the choice of location. We chose the Region 7 meeting location to be Seattle because it is a metropolitan city and has venues capable of supporting large conferences.<a href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Commercial flight paths are usually longer then the geodesic distance between two points. Our flight emissions model corrects for this difference.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>We performed a benchmarking analysis on the two data sets by measuring the relative increase in attendance within a 400 km radius of the meeting.<a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
