In this post, I reexamine the ways we navigate to large conferences from around the world and how the carbon emissions of such conferences can be mitigated while still preserving the important community-building from such events. I consider the carbon footprint of holding multiple, smaller conferences instead of holding one large centrally-located conference. I call this framework a *regional format* for conferences throughout this post.

This post is a case study expanding upon the solutions offered by @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641, a paper recently published by myself and a team of Psychiatrists at the [Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP).](https://ourgap.org) We estimated the carbon footprint associated with the 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings of the [American Psychiatric Association (APA)](https://www.psychiatry.org/about-apa) then measured how this carbon footprint changes if meetings are held in different locations.^[We measured the effect of moving both the 2018 and 2019 meetings by _shifting_ the original location of each meeting to 13 different locations that the APA has used over the past 40+ years. In addition to measuring the carbon footprint from these 13 alternate locations, we employed a minimization procedure which identified a narrow region on the Earth that would globally minimize the carbon footprint, given the attendance data for each Annual Meeting.]
The APA is the largest psychiatric association in the world with almost 40 thousand members worldwide.^[_See_ https://www.psychiatry.org/about-apa]

@10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641 quantifies the impact of location on the carbon footprint of the APA Annual Meeting. For example, holding the Annual Meeting in Hawaii would produce more emissions than holding over 2.5 Annual Meetings in New York City if the same people attended.^[Such an assessment assumes that the exact same people will show up to a meeting in Hawaii and a meeting in New York City and this is probably not true.  Nonetheless, the analysis still provides us with a guage for the impact of meeting location. The issues with analyzing attendance data from individual meetings will be discussed later in this post. _See_ Table in @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641 for the full assessment of meeting locations.] 
We argue that large conferences like the APA Annual Meeting should incorporate the added environmental cost of remote conference destinations. **By taking into account the geographic dispersion of their attendance base and choosing a location accordingly, large conferences can drastically reduce their environmental impact while changing little else.** This post expands upon @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641 by examining the impact of breaking up large conferences into smaller regional ones. 

<!-- and the potential of a *regional conference format* to mitigate carbon emissions on top ofo ptimizing conference location. -->


## The Story


<!-- Recently, I got the opportunity to support some great research with a team of Psychiatrists on the [GAP Climate Committee.](https://ourgap.org/page-18095) In the midst of the pandemic lock-downs we sought a silver lining and exploited the global transformation of the day-to-day movement of humans.  -->

<!-- The unique situation of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to use this research as a gauge for how much carbon emissions *were saved &nbsp;* by holding the 2020 APA conference virtually.^[The APA has also chosen host the 2021 Annual Meeting virtually as well. _See_ https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/meetings/annual-meeting.] -->
<!-- In fact, that decision prompted the idea for this research. If you are interested in the original analysis, you may read the paper at [JAMA Network Open (no paywall).](https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641) -->


The COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way *humans* move through space and this change foreshadows the dramatic behavioral and structural shifts climate change demands from humankind.^[This radical *anthropause* has no doubt effected wildlife as well. *See* @Rutz2020.] Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with work commutes and industry/professional travel have substantially decreased, leading to distinct improvements in air and water quality (*see* @YUNUS2020139012 and @Venter18984). The International Energy Agency expects global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to drop 8% compared to 2019, the largest reduction ever (@IEA-Global-energy).

<!--Tourism, responsible for 8% of global GHG emissions, has all but stopped (@Lenzen2018). --->

In the wake of lockdowns and mass cancellations clearer skies and lack of traffic made the benefits of reduced travel real. It has given us an opportunity to reevaluate the importance of shared spaces and the ways we navigate to and embody them. In fact, it was the cancellation of the 2020 in-person APA Annual Meeting which formed the impetus for this research.

As with any evaluation, we wanted to understand the costs associated with holding the meeting---including the environmental ones. We wanted to know how much carbon emissions were saved by cancelling the meeting. As we return to *"normal"*, I hope this research provokes a more thoughtful return---one that considers both the need for shared spaces and the costs of bringing people to them.

<!-- This unprecedented reduction in activity has certainly come with many costs, but it is at this crux that such a reassessment can be most enlightening and effective. As we long to return to *"normal"*, I hope that this research provokes a more thoughtful return---one that acknowledges both the need for shared spaces and the costs of bring people to them.  -->

<!-- especially when these spaces function as epicenters for building specialized communities whose members are otherwise scattered throughout the world---whether that be communities centered upon medical associations, [comic books](https://comic-con.org/wca/2021/athome), [insurance](https://www.itic.co/), [SCUBA-diving](https://scubashow.com/), [recreational vehicles](https://seattlervshow.com/), or [mushrooms](https://waset.org/mycology-conferences) (a personal favorite). -->

The carbon footprint of such conferences has been shown to be substantial. @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641 estimate the 2018 and 2019 APA Annual Meetings produced about 20 thousand metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions each---an amount equal to burning 22 million pounds of coal. ***ADD NATURE CITATION*** This carbon footprint is highly dependent on the meeting location as the majority of carbon emissions are incurred through travel.

The case study is by no means limited to the context of the APA. There are hundreds of medical and medical professional associations across the US^[_See_ <https://www.meditec.com/resourcestools/professional-associations-list> for a incomplete list of medical and professional associations similar to the APA.] and thousands more industry, professional, hobby, and entertainment based conventions held yearly. As of 2017, almost 35 million square meters of indoor space was dedicated to some form of exhibition.^[Exhibition space is defined as the amount of gross space in the venue regularly marketed and rented/licensed/used for exhibitions, trade fairs or consumer/public shows. This space is measured for any public assembly premises with a minimum of 5,000 square meters of indoor exhibition space and that hold various types of exhibitions, trade fairs or consumer/public shows on a regular basis. The premises may be purpose-built exhibition center space or other premises including exhibition space (e.g. hotels, arenas, sport venues, and amusement fair grounds). _See_ [UFI World Map Of Exhibition Venues (2017 Edition, Revised December 2018).](https://www.ufi.org/archive-research/ufi-world-map-of-exhibition-venues-2017-edition-revised-december-2018/)] The APA Annual Meeting does not draw a large population even in the context of medical associations, let alone framed within the global exhibition industry. When we consider the impact of such *carbon-conscious* planning on an industry-level, the potential reduction in emissions could be considerable.


## A Language of Emisisons

Before we dig into the details of this case study, I want to discuss some common terminology that is often mischaracterized. I am intentionally guilty of some of this so far. I have chosen to conflate terms like *emissions, carbon emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, carbon footprint,* and *environmental impact* in order to tease out some important distinctions.

Often times, these phrases are used as synonyms, but this is not the case. Most people understand that a carbon footprint is some measure of environmental impact: that a high carbon footprint = bad and a low carbon footprint = less bad. This is somewhat true, but there are many aspects of *environmental impact* that the *carbon footprint* does not measure.^[Even comparing carbon footprints between contexts can be problematic for reasons discussed later.]

<!-- For example, [Deepwater Horizon](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article240263391.html), the largest oil spill in history^[@Fisher11744], caused unimaginable damage to natural ecosystems yet very little of this impact can be captured through the lens of the carbon footprint. Studies on the *environmental impacts* of Deepwater Horizon range from the severe harm of surface oil on marine mammals to the habitat destruction of deep-water coral and microfauna.^[_See_ https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/apr17/dwh-protected-species.html for the environmental impacts on marine mammals and sea turtles. _See_ @Fisher11744 for the effects on deep-water coral. _See_ @Reuscher2020 for the effects on microfauna and more.] ***Add https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0046-x here *** -->

<!-- Minor aspects of the spill have been studied through the lens of carbon footprint. For example, during the spill large amounts of oil leaked towards the ocean surface where one of the main remediation strategies was "controlled surface burning."^[@NOAA-deepwater. This is a common technique of spill remediation. _See_ @evans2001situ.] -->
<!-- @FISG-deepwater estimate approximately 5% of the **total leaked oil** was burned on the surface, releasing over one million pounds (450 metric tons) of black carbon soot into the atmosphere.^[@NOAA-deepwater.] This amount pales in comparison to the true damage from the oil spill. -->

<!-- My point here is that the *carbon footprint* (which we have yet to define) is not a holistic measure of environmental friendliness/harm and it is potentially harmful to use carbon footprint as a gauge for how harmful something is.^[Even comparing carbon footprints between contexts can be problematic for reasons discussed later.] The most damaging human-induced events like oil spills or nuclear meltdowns have carbon footprints far outmeasured by the loss of wildlife and habitat. -->


### History of the Carbon Footprint

Though I use the term *carbon footprint* throughout this post, I want to acknowledge the (not so pretty) history behind the term. The phrase grew out of a related concept---the *ecological footprint*---invented in the 1990s by ecologist William Rees and regional planner Mathis Wackernagel.^[Selin, N. Eckley. *Carbon footprint. Encyclopedia Britannica.* https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-footprint.]

However it was not until the early 2000s that the term was popularized by oil giant BP. In 2004, BP unveiled the first "carbon footprint calculator" which provided individuals with a way to quantify how much heat-trapping carbon pollution they were releasing into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, it provided users with no way of measuring the carbon footprint of drilling deep into the Earth to extract fossil fuels and occasionally dumping thousands of gallons of it into the ocean.

Shifting the discourse of pollution onto the individual has long been a tactic of the largest corporate polluters. **Research on global warming must acknowledge and push back against this narrative.**

<!-- Even before we thought to worry about carbon pollution, we had marketing campaigns touting the righteousness of voluntary action. Recycling, bottle bills, and littering. In what appears to be the longest ad any millennial has ever seen, the famous "Crying Indian" first aired in 1971 on Earth day with the line: "People start pollution. People can stop it." Little did they know corporations would become people anyways.^[_See_ https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained] -->

<!-- I will refrain from saying much else on this matter, but if you're curious I would dig into the [history of pollution marketing](https://in.mashable.com/science/15520/the-carbon-footprint-sham) or [why you can't save the planet by going vegan.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/03/climate-change-requires-collective-action-more-than-single-acts-column/1275965001/) -->

<!-- Oh yeah, in case you were getting tired of punching in your electricity bill into BP's carbon footprint calculator to help you sleep at night, don't worry. BP has gone through the trouble of [developing an app that does it for you](https://grist.org/energy/footprint-fantasy), backed by their quasi venture capital subsidiary, Launchpad. -->


### Measuring the Carbon Footprint

Greenhouse gases are not all the same. Some are better at absorbing heat than others, and some last longer in the atmosphere before breaking down.
<!-- ^[_See_ @brander2012greenhouse.] -->
Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most common GHG emitted by human activities, both in terms of the quantity released and the total impact on global warming. Due to this, “CO<sub>2</sub>” is sometimes used as a shorthand expression for all greenhouse gases, but this is misleading. Greenhouse gas inventories are more complete if they include all GHGs involved and not just CO<sub>2</sub>; However, many assessments only include CO<sub>2</sub> leading to an understatement of the total impact to global warming (@brander2012greenhouse).

We can gauge the warming capabilities of different GHGs by using a relative scale. That is, by measuring how much additional warming they cause compared to carbon dioxide over a period of time, usually 100 years. Such a measurement is referred to as *global warming potential* (GWP). The table below illustrates some common GHGs and their GWP. The higher the GWP, the worse the impact to global warming.

<!-- Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most common GHG emitted by human activities, both in terms of the quantity released and the total impact on global warming.

Greenhouse gas inventories are more complete if they include all GHGs involved and not just CO<sub>2</sub>; However, many assessments only include CO<sub>2</sub> leading to an understatement of the total impact to global warming (@brander2012greenhouse).  -->

<!-- Sometimes this measure of only CO<sub>2</sub> is referred to as the *carbon footprint* of a process, but usually other GHGs are involved in which case it is better to refer to such a measure as the total *carbon dioxide emissions,* rather than the *carbon footprint*. -->

The table above describes different GHGs under a common unit called *carbon dioxide equivalents* (CO<sub>2</sub>*e*). CO<sub>2</sub>*e* captures the total impact to global warming by measuring how much carbon dioxide it would take to have an equivalent impact as another greenhouse gas.

CO<sub>2</sub>*e* is a very useful measure because it allows us to bundle different GHGs and compare them.^[Comparing CO<sub>2</sub>*e* across contexts (different studies) is more problematic, often because the types of GHGs which go into the carbon footprint calculation may not be the same. The GWP for a given gas may also differ.] For example, let's say we want to capture the total impact to global warming from a process that emits 1 kilogram of methane gas and 1 kilogram of sulfur hexafluoride gas. We can measure the impact in units of CO<sub>2</sub>*e* by multiplying the mass of each gas by its corresponding GWP. Using the table above, the impact to global warming from these gasses would be equivalent to,
$$\begin{align} 1\ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{methane} \ \times 25 &= 25 \ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{CO}_2e \\ 
1\ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{sulfur hexafluoride} \ \times 23,500 &= 23,500 \ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{CO}_2e
\\ &= 23,525 \ \textrm{kg} \ \textrm{CO}_2e.
\end{align}$$

Thus, we would say this process has a carbon footprint of 23,525 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. That is, the total impact to global warming from this process is equivalent to a process which emits 23,525 kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub>.^[One issue with comparing CO<sub>2</sub>*e* across contexts is that the gases included in the measurement may not be the same. One must make sure the GHGs being converted into CO<sub>2</sub>*e* are the same. If a measure does not include sulfur hexafluoride in its calculation, for example, then it may not be a fair comparison to another carbon footprint which does include sulfur hexafluoride in its calculation of CO<sub>2</sub>*e* emissions.]

Terms like *carbon emissions* or just *emissions* are often used as reference to a variety of measurements for global warming. Sometimes they are used to refer to just CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and other times they are used to refer to all GHGs in general.^[Converting CO<sub>2</sub> or other GHGs to their elemental carbon counterparts does little to aid in comparison across GHGs. Rather it is generally used as a shorthand in terms like "carbon accounting" or "low carbon future" as proxies for the more accurate "GHG accounting" or "low GHG future."] Its best to be explicit with our measurements so that we holistically capture what we can measure and acknowledge what we cannot. In what follows, I return to the analysis of regional conferences and will do my best to avoid further conflating terminology.

## A Regional Conference Format

Regional conferences do not bring whole communities together in one space, but there are many aspects that make regional conferences an attractive format---especially if they are held as supplements to centralized conferences.

Regional conferences are much smaller and usually break up a community into geographically-connected regions. This smaller format may be easier to administer, less costly, and provide attendees with more intimate opportunities to network with local colleagues. Smaller meetings may increase engagement in working groups or activities limited by size or participation.

Regional conferences allow for discourse built-up from a more concentrated membership. This may be particularly beneficial for associations advancing policy because such a format allows regions to develop sets of priorities most relevant to them (such as focusing on state or municipal policy) and then advance this smaller set of priorities to the larger base whose scale may in turn provide much needed support.

For example, US-based medical associations assess and respond to range of policies at the federal and state levels. A regional conference format may allow for discourse that takes place in these few days to focus more on important state/local regulation which may not appear on the horizon for members outside of that region or district. This format encourages regional members to hone their priorities before larger meetings and present a more concise set of objectives to the entire association rather than having to weigh these priorities simultaneously against a larger set where they are more likely to go unacknowledged.

Regional meetings may also have the potential to increase total attendance and subsequently revenue. Some members may find it too expensive or too time consuming to travel long distances to centrally-located conferences. This may alienate sections of the member base in fringe geographies and discourage others who feel not enough of their colleagues will attend.

Traveling to remote conference destinations can be attractive for those who wish this time to double as a vacation, but it may leave the conference vulnerable to drops in attendance as some locations are more favorable than others.^[For example, medical associations host a disproportionately small amount of conferences in Las Vegas because physicians don't like to gamble!] More importantly, such a framework may introduce priorities contradictory to emissions reduction. Meeting planners may be encouraged to hold meetings in more remote places to encourage attendance and significantly increase emissions from travel as a result.


## A Regional Format for the APA

Regional formats can be easy to implement in medical associations or associations involved with advancing policy because there are often existing structures in the administration allowing regions or districts to act independently to a degree. US-based medical associations, like the APA, often have some international base which may or may not be included in the regional structure.^[Often times, select international countries may be lumped in with domestic US regions. This is the case with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) as well as the APA, which groups Canadian regions together with US regions. Other times, international members may not be part of any region and simply attend the large annual or national meetings.]

The APA has 7 distinct regions between the US and Canada.^[Including US protectorates.] Below is a map of these regions:

![](/images/regional-conferences/APA-regions.png)

1. New England & Eastern Canada [<span style="color:#22A884FF">⬤</span>]
2. New York [<span style="color:#414487FF">⬤</span>]
3. Middle Atlantic [<span style="color:#23888EFF">⬤</span>]
4. North Central [<span style="color:#31688EFF">⬤</span>]
5. American South & Puerto Rico [<span style="color:#54C568FF">⬤</span>]
6. California [<span style="color:#FDE725FF">⬤</span>]
7. American West & Western Canada [<span style="color:#A5DB36FF">⬤</span>]

The APA has a considerable amount of international members, but only Canadians are given a regional designation.

## Simulation Framework

***DISCUSS Wortzel et al. framework - its what the people came for***

Using attendance data from the APA's 2018 New York City and 2019 San Francisco Annual Meetings, we assign each attendee to one of seven designated regions based on their origin location and then identify likely transport modes and routes according the assumptions laid out in @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641.

<!-- ^[Specifically, we classify attendees into drivers if they are within 400 km of the regional meeting they are attending. Attendees more than 400 km away from their regional meeting will drive to their nearest commercial airport and then fly to the airport nearest the regional meeting location. The driving distance is measured as the geodesic distances between locatoins. We then apply an emissions function to the ground and air legs of each attendee's route. These emissions functions are based on EPA guidelines and a [flight emissions API from GoClimate.](https://api.goclimate.com/docs)] -->

Our simulation classifies attendees into either drivers or fliers based on their geodesic distance from the meeting location. Attendees less than 400 km (under 4 hr. driving) are assumed to drive directly to the meeting. All other attendees drive to the closest commercial airport and then fly direct to the nearest commercial airport to the meeting. We then apply an emissions function to the ground and air legs of each attendee's round-trip route.^[The driving distance is measured as the geodesic distances between locations and therefore underestimates the total driving distance. We use the [EPA guidelines](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle) to estimate the emissions from passenger vehicles. We use GoClimate's [flight emissions API](https://api.goclimate.com/docs) to estimate emissions from air travel. The flight emissions API performs a number of additional methods to correct for flight detours (since flights often take a longer route then the geodesic distance), number of passengers, cabin class, and variable short-distance and long-distance fuel consumption.]

In order to simulate the way attendees would travel to the regional conferences, I had to extend some assumptions from our previous analysis. One critical assumption was how to deal with non-Canadian international attendees which are not assigned to any region in the APA's existing structure.^[25-30 percent of the 2018 and 2019 APA Annual Meeting attendees are international attendees (including Canadians).] In this respect we assume non-Canadian international attendees will travel to whichever meeting is closest. This also ensures our emissions estimation remains conservative.

The second extending assumption was the location of the seven regional meetings. The purpose of the analysis is to quantify the affect of holding multiple regional conferences compared one large meeting *ceteris paribus*. However, in @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641 we show that the location of the meeting can have a large impact on the carbon footprint.^[As we add more meetings, we reduce the impact of location because the variation in the average attendee's distance to the meeting be capped.] In order to isolate the effect of moving to a regional format and eliminate the noise from different locations, we chose to:

i. Re-use locations of past APA Annual meetings whenever possible.^[The one exception to this case was choosing a location for Region 7 because no meetings have historically been held this area. The choice of the Region 7 location is particularly important because Region 7 has the largest area of all the APA regions, and this greater distance members must travel will increase the sensitivity of the carbon emission estimates with respect to the choice of location. We chose the Region 7 meeting location to be Seattle because it is a metropolitan city and has venues capable of supporting large conferences.]

ii. Conduct an additional sensitivity test on regional meeting locations allowing *all* attendees to travel to the closest regional meeting, regardless of their designation.

Below is a map of the seven regional meeting locations used in the simulation:
   
![](/images/regional-conferences/Regional-locations.png)


## Visualizing Regions

To understand the effect of the regional categorization, we can compare the flight networks for the original Annual Meeting framework. The map below shows everyone who attended the 2018 Annual Meeting in New York City, over 16 thousand people. Each light point represents a unique origin where the size and opacity of the points is proportional to the number of attendees traveling from that location. The darker-orange arcs indicate the *geodesic distance* or distance *as the crow flies* between each residence and the location of the 2018 New York City meeting.^[Geodesic distance is the shortest path between two points on the globe. Commercial flight paths are usually longer then the geodesic distance between two points. Our flight emissions model corrects for this difference.]

![](/images/regional-conferences/NYC-network.png)

Here we can see all attendees converge on the [Javits Center](https://goo.gl/maps/gekiRZY7aPxe7qUo9) in New York City. 

Now, let's examine the map under the APA's regional designations and assign international (non-Canadian) attendees a regional destination according to assumption *(i)*. The map below colors each APA region distinctly. The width and intensity the arcs is proportional to the number of attendees originating from that location.

***INCREASE LEGEND SIZE***

![](/images/regional-conferences/NYC-regional-network.png)

The map of the regional framework shows most of the European attendees getting absorbed into Region 3 (purple, New York City conference). Most of the Asian attendees are absorbed by Region 7 (lime green, Seattle conference), and most of the Australian attendees are absorbed by Region 6 (yellow, Los Angeles conference).

Though it may not be clear from the maps, we want to make sure that our regional simulation is plausible such that it balances the attendance base of the APA somewhat evenly across regions.

Behind the scenes I import the simulation data and plot the attendance base across regions by transport mode. If you are curious, all the code for this is available at my [GitHub](https://github.com/Alec-Stashevsky/GAP-climate-research/blob/c3c960efd5138ef34c326f12693f223509fa3097/code/Regional%20Analysis/05%20-%20Regional%20Emissions%20Plots.Rmd).

The left panel of the column plot below shows the attendance for each regional conference using the APA's attendance data from the 2018 New York City Annual Meeting. The panel on the right uses attendance data collected from the 2019 San Francisco Annual Meeting (not shown on above maps). Each bar represents an APA Region and the bars are colored by the transport mode the attendees took to each region. A larger area of purple would indicate more attendees driving directly to the meeting, rather than flying (turquoise). 


***Attendance is somewhat evenly distributed across regions***
```{r Regional Attendance Plots, echo=FALSE}
# Read data
attend.data <- readRDS("~/website-update2/content/post/regional-conferences/RegionalAttendance.RDs")

# Attendance by Region and Transport Mode
ggplot(attend.data, aes(x = Region,
   y = Attendance, fill = `Transport Mode`)) +
   geom_col() +
   facet_wrap(~`Attendance Base`) +
   labs(
      x = "Regional Meeting (APA Region)",
      y = "Number of Attendees"
      ) +
   scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = 0.1, end = 0.4) +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
   theme(
      plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "cm"),
      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1.1),
      axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(10, 0, 0, 0)),
      axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(0, 10, 0, 0)),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
      legend.position = "bottom",
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff8e3"),
      legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff8e3"),
      strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#e8d8c3")
      )
```

The attendance at each regional meeting is around 1.5 to 3 thousand, with the exception of Region 2 on the left panel (2018 Data). This is a good indication that the regional designations assigned by the APA and our assumptions about international attendees break the membership base into somewhat even parts. The exception is the New York city meeting because it captures the majority of international attendees, whom are largely from Europe (see regional map above). When we use the 2019 Data the attendance is much more even.


## Regional Simulation Resuts

Following our assumptions, I estimate total GHG emissions for the meetings under the regional conference format. The table below presents the results for the 2018 New York City and 2019 San Francisco simulations, respectively. The carbon footprint of the attendees' commute to the meetings is measured by the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>*e*).

The total emissions are significantly lower under the regional conference format. Compared to the original meeting at the Javits Center in the NYC, a regional conference format would save almost 5 thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents—a 25% reduction. The regional format of SF meeting reduced more than half of the original meeting's emissions.

Why do the SF regional meetings save so much more emissions than the NYC meetings? One reason is because people had to travel farther to attend the original SF Annual Meeting which made it less efficient than the NYC meeting. Though over 3,300 fewer people attended the SF meeting, almost 2,000 more tons of CO<sub>2</sub>*e* was produced.^[We can also see this by examining the per-capita carbon footprint which measures the average carbon emissions of an attendee. San Francisco attendees produced over 400 kg (0.4 metric tons) more CO<sub>2</sub>*e* on average compared to attendees of the New York meeting.] This is because the majority of the APA membership base who attended the 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings are from the East Coast, so it makes sense that the meetings closest to this region will reduce emissions.

In @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641, we build a geometric minimization algorithm (also known as *facility-location*) to find the optimal meeting location regardless of any constraints. We sample 100 thousand coordinates across the globe randomly and select the point which produces the smallest aggregate travel distance for all attendees. We find that the Northwestern US is the optimal region to host the APA Annual Meeting, provided the attendance base remains similarly dispersed geographically. The regions below contain the top 10 points selected by the algorithm for each data set. *Note* an additional data set for the Philadelphia 2020 Meeting is included. This meeting was cancelled due to the pandemic and the attendance data is incomplete. Nonetheless, the results hold.

### Bias in Attendance Data

I won't go into all the implications of why the 2018 and 2019 attendance data sets may be different, but I want to address some inherent biases in the data. Because these data were observed based on the actual attendance of the 2018 and 2019 APA Annual Meetings, we need to consider how this may affect our analysis---specifically our ability to compare between meetings or predict whom will attend what meetings.

The farther away a conference is the less likely one is to attend. Traveling further away is more costly, more time consuming, and it is much easier to drive directly rather than fly if its reasonable. Such factors influence the subset of the APA's membership who attend each meeting. We can think of this phenomenon as *geographic bias.*

Such bias appears to be present in the APA attendance data. The 2018 New York City meeting data shows a smaller proportion of members from the West Coast while the proportion of attendees from the West Coast increased the the following year at the San Francisco meeting. This is why the optimal location for the SF meeting is slightly west of the NYC and PHL meetings in the minimization results above.

<!-- ^[*See* @10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35641 Figure.] -->

Though the APA has almost 40 thousand members, only about 13 - 17 thousand attended the meetings. Thus, it is important to have a sense of what factors draw out certain sections of the APA membership and how that could affect our results. It is clear that the meeting location exerts influence over who attends through proximity; However, there is likely a nexus of factors that we cannot observe by simply comparing the two data sets. If we were to perform a similar analysis using only one year it is very likely that our results would be biased towards the people closest to that meeting. We might find that meetings held closer to this critical mass are optimal, but we know nothing about what that attendance *would* look like in an alternate universe where the APA Meeting was held under the beautiful Grand Tetons in, say, Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

A broader set of attendance data---especially data which includes a geographically-diverse set of conferences---would make it possible to tease out the different sections of the APA's membership that *would have come* if the meeting was closer to them.^[We performed a benchmarking analysis on the two data sets by measuring the relative increase in attendance within a 400 km radius of the meeting. ***ADD RESULTS***]








One reason the recu

* We can see the emissions is lower for the regions by XYZ. [X]
* Why is the reduction for SF so much larger? [X]
  * Explain optimality for NYC based on APA attendance base [X]
* Mention impact of the sensitivity analysis


* CHANGE carbon emission to GHG emission in later section of the post after explanation of terminology











**Wrap Up**

We need to reevaluate the purposes and priorties for large conferences. This means rethinking frameworks that promote industy/proffesional conferences as a chance to "get away" while still growing professionally.
