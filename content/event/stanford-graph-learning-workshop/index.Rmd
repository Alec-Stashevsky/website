summary: Industry presentation at Stanford Graph Learning Workshop on combining layout transformers with graph transformers.

<br> 

Last week I got the opportunity to share how we are using graph transformer networks, in particular [PyTorch Geometric](https://www.pyg.org/) to augment layout transformers to perform complex semantic modeling on visually rich documents like receipts. We use graph neural networks augmented with layout transformer embeddings to model semantic topology as a link-prediction task. Check out the talk below.
