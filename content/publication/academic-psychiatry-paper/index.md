abstract: Global warming is a public health emergency that poses significant threats to mental health. The need for graduate medical education about the effects of climate change on health has increasing support from organizations like the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but it is unclear what is currently taught in psychiatry residencies training about the mental health impacts of global warming. We therefore designed an online module to assess what U.S. psychiatry trainees currently learn about the impacts of climate change on mental health to determine the perceived importance of learning about this topic
